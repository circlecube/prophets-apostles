App Description
__
LDS Quiz will test your knowledge of and teach you about the apostles and prophets. 

Do you know your LDS Church leaders? This quiz will not only test your knowledge, but teach you about the respected apostles and prophets we follow.

Too often they are just a name or a face, let's put the names and faces together and learn about their teachings and examples.

There are multiple groups to be quizzed on:
  Current (living) apostles by selecting the apostles tab.
  Prophet mode and you will be quizzed only on presidents of the church.
  There is also a study mode which will list all the current apostles along with their names followed by all the latter day prophets or presidents of the church (whichever mode is active). 


There are many levels too!
