Do you know your LDS Church leaders? This quiz will not only test your knowledge, but teach you about the respected apostles and prophets we follow.

Too often they are just a name or a face, let's put the names and faces together and learn about their teachings and examples.

There are two groups to be quizzed on. Either select to be quizzed on current (living) apostles by selecting the apostles tab, or select the prophet mode and you will be quizzed on presidents of the church. There is also a study mode which will list all the current apostles along with their names followed by all the latter day prophets or presidents of the church. 


There are also multiple levels to each group. 
Face - the original. Pick the right apostle/prophet from 4 images (multiple choice) when given a name.
Young Face - depictions of the apostles and prophets when they were young (or at least younger). - PRO
Initial - Name the initial in their name, be it their middle name or their first. - PRO
Birthday - Pick the apostle/prophet by their birthday and age. - PRO
Hometown - Pick by hometown or town they were born in. - PRO

Coming Soon:
Who Came First (seniority/order) - Name them in order.
Conference Talks - the total number of General Conference messages given to date. 
Name that Face â€“ Pick the right name when shown an image
